#### C-13 enrichment of mycos by species ####
# Does the C-13 enrichment of mycorrhizas depend on the species
# of fungus forming the mycorrhiza, controlling for competitor
# identity and N addition level?

# Arg√ºello model: 
# log(14C in hyphal compartment A) ~ 
# AMF fungus side A*AMF fungus side B + 
# plant species identity + random pot effect
# with C labeling group "as a covariate." Does this mean as a random effect?

# Plant ID and C-13 labeling batch should  be random effects here.
# Ideally, I'd have a random slope for each,
# but a random intercept is all I can do with my dataset
# and is probably reasonable.


# To be clear about my hypotheses:
# Fungal identity should be significant
# Competitor identity should be significant
# N level should be significant
# *Interaction between fungal identity and N level MIGHT be significant
# *Interaction between fungal identity and competitor identity MIGHT be significant
# *Interaction between competitor identity and N level MIGHT be significant
# * Three way interaction between fungus and competitor and N level MIGHT be significant.
