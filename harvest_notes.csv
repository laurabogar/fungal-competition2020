6028,a,"some THETE proto-crust AF, very dry soil AR. High-N mycos (esp. THETE) will probably be gritter than Low-N; hyphae hold dirt."

6034,b,Although it's hard to tell -- both odl SUIPU and normal THETE is a sort of cafe au lauit color -- I think we hvae some SUIPU (mostly old) and THETE growing out of it.

6098,a,"lots of dead or nearly-dead SUIPU looking mycos w/NM roots protruding. Very little THETE -- collected all i could find for isotopes, but there's non in % pool."
